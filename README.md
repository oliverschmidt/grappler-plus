# Grappler+

This project is based on [A2Pico](https://github.com/oliverschmidt/a2pico).

Ultimately this project could emulate a complete [Grappler+ Printer Interface](https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/Apple%20II%20Documentation%20Project/Interface%20Cards/Parallel/Orange%20Micro%20Grappler%20plus%20Printer%20Interface/). However, currently it only emulates the Grappler+ ROM.

Please note that the actual 6502 firmware in the ROM is __not__ part of this repository. Rather, a 4kB file `grappler-plus.rom` must be provided.
